# Data visualization project

Solution for the [Learn JavaScript](https://learnjavascript.online) data visualization project. 

This is a Chart representing the **browser usage data in 2019**. I used **Chart.js** in this project.

If you want to install the chart.js library in your own project on your computer after downloading this repo, you need to use **npm** and run the following code in your terminal:

`npm install chart.js --save`

You do not need to import it as I've already done that for you in the `index.js` file.
